# CDK app

Builds the deployment drawn in `../docs/aws-deployment.drawio`. Every choice the
diagram did not make is written down in `../docs/cdk-decisions.md`.

Needs Python 3.10+, Node 20+, and the CDK CLI (`npm install -g aws-cdk`).

    cd cdk
    python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cdk synth

`cdk synth` prints the CloudFormation template and writes it to `cdk.out/`. It
does not touch AWS and needs no credentials.
